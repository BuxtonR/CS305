# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is an international financial consulting firm specializing in creating personalized financial plans for their clients. They approached us to enhance the security of their existing web-based application, which handles sensitive financial data. The primary issue they wanted us to address was the identification and mitigation of any security vulnerabilities that could compromise client information and impact their business operations.

# What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I excelled at conducting a thorough vulnerability assessment, where I systematically identified potential security risks within the application. Secure coding is essential because it ensures that sensitive data is protected, and the integrity of the application is maintained. Effective software security not only safeguards the company's reputation and trust with clients but also prevents financial losses and ensures compliance with industry regulations.

# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most challenging aspect of the vulnerability assessment was discerning false positives from actual vulnerabilities. It required a deep understanding of the application's codebase to make informed decisions about which issues posed real threats. However, this challenge was also beneficial as it strengthened my ability to critically analyze security reports and improve the overall security posture of the application.

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I enhanced the security layers by implementing measures such as input validation, encryption of sensitive data, and secure authentication protocols. In the future, I would use a combination of automated tools like static code analyzers and manual reviews to assess vulnerabilities. Prioritizing mitigation techniques would be based on the severity and potential impact of the vulnerabilities, ensuring that the most critical issues are addressed first.

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To ensure that the code and application were both functional and secure, I performed rigorous functional and security testing before and after refactoring the code. I used tools like OWASP Dependency-Check to identify any newly introduced vulnerabilities post-refactoring and compared the results to ensure that the application remained secure.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
For this project, I utilized resources such as the OWASP Dependency-Check tool for static testing, which proved invaluable in identifying third-party library vulnerabilities. Additionally, I adhered to secure coding practices like input validation and encryption, which are fundamental in building robust applications. These tools and practices will be crucial in future assignments to maintain high security standards.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would present the vulnerability assessment report and the refactored code as examples. The report highlights my ability to identify and mitigate security risks, while the refactored code demonstrates my skills in implementing secure coding practices. These examples showcase my expertise in enhancing software security and ensuring the reliability of the application.
